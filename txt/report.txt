Linux is Operating System and Ubuntu is a flavor/version/destros of linux  like ( w10 ).
We install WSL and Ubuntu but encounter an error while running it and resolve through this following step.
Going in Optional Features/More Window features then enabling virtual machine platform and  Windows Linux Subsystem.
After successfully installing tha WSL and Ubuntu we create linux acc using terminal
and to add another user we use the following command :sudo useradd user_name and :sudo passwd user_name. 
Other commands that discuss are cd to navigate folders,cp to perform copy, mv to perform move,
mv to perform move, rm to remove files or folder, ls to show list, mkdir to create directory or folder,
rmdir remove directiory or folder, cat display file contents, 
less is like cat but will display fewer contents, head display  the first 10 lines of a file, 
head -n diplay specific number of lines, tail is the reverse of head,touch  provide timestamp or create file,
chmod change permission of file (chmod 755 _file), chown change file ownership, find to search files and directories,
sudo means superuser do, it bypass everything and be careful of using it. Other commands we tried are deluser and clear.
In creating the report.txt in the activity we prefer use to the VIM as text editor. 
I use the cd .. to navigate folder and mkdir to create a folder name "report folder".Perform a cd "folder name" then  Create this report.txt
and edit its contents with this path ~/report folder/report.txt.
